## 📊 Example Usage

### **Question:**
> "What are attention mechanisms in transformers?"

### **Answer:**
> "Attention mechanisms are a key component of transformer architectures that allow the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when processing each element. According to the paper 'Attention Is All You Need', attention mechanisms compute a weighted sum of values based on the similarity between queries and keys, enabling the model to capture long-range dependencies without recurrence..."

### **Sources:**
1. **Attention Is All You Need** (95% match)
   - "The Transformer model architecture is based entirely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions..."

2. **BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers** (88% match)
   - "BERT uses multi-head self-attention to process input sequences bidirectionally..."
