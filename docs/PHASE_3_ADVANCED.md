## Technical Specifications

### Code Analysis Workflow
```
Paper with GitHub Link → Code Analyzer Agent →
  → Clone Repository → Analyze Structure →
  → Check Dependencies → Test Installation →
  → Generate Report → Create Issues (if needed)
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination
```
Conductor Agent
├── Spawns Retrieval Agent (parallel)
├── Spawns Synthesis Agent (parallel)
├── Spawns Verification Agent (sequential)
└── Aggregates Results → Writer Agent
```

### Private Data Integration
```
User Query → Check Permissions →
  → Search Public Sources (MCP) +
  → Search Private Sources (S3/SQL/ES) →
  → Merge Results → Deduplicate → Return
```
