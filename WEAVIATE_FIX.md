# 🔧 Weaviate Vector Search Fix

**Issue:** `VectorFromInput was called without vectorizer on class PaperChunk`

**Root Cause:** The Weaviate schema was configured with `vectorizer: 'none'` (correct for custom embeddings), but the search was trying to use hybrid search which requires a built-in vectorizer.

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### **1. Updated Vector Store Search Method**
Changed from hybrid search (which needs a vectorizer) to pure vector search with our own embeddings.

**Before:**
```typescript
// Used hybrid search (BM25 + vector) - requires vectorizer
queryBuilder.withHybrid({
  query,
  alpha: 0.75
})
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Use vector search with our own embedding
queryBuilder.withNearVector({
  vector: queryVector  // Our own embedding
})
```

### **2. Updated RAG Pipeline**
Now generates query embedding before searching.

**Before:**
```typescript
const results = await this.vectorStore.search({
  query,
  hybrid: true  // ❌ Requires vectorizer
})
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Generate query embedding
const [queryEmbedding] = await this.embeddingService.embed([query])

// Search with our embedding
const results = await this.vectorStore.search({
  query,
  queryVector: queryEmbedding  // ✅ Use our embedding
})
```

### **3. Fixed Score Calculation**
Weaviate returns `distance`, we convert it to similarity score.

```typescript
// Convert distance to similarity (1 - distance)
const distance = item._additional.distance || 0
const score = 1 - distance  // Higher score = more similar
```

## 🔍 How It Works Now

```
User Question
    ↓
Embed question with OpenAI
    ↓
Search Weaviate with query vector
    ↓
Get nearest neighbors (cosine similarity)
    ↓
Convert distance to score (1 - distance)
    ↓
Filter by minScore (default 0.7)
    ↓
Return top results
```

---

## 📊 Search Flow

### **1. Question Embedding**
```typescript
const [queryEmbedding] = await embeddingService.embed([question])
// Returns: [0.123, -0.456, 0.789, ...] (1536 dimensions)
```

### **2. Vector Search**
```typescript
const results = await vectorStore.search({
  query: question,
  queryVector: queryEmbedding,
  limit: 5,
  minScore: 0.7
})
```

### **3. Weaviate Query**
```graphql
{
  Get {
    PaperChunk(
      nearVector: {
        vector: [0.123, -0.456, ...]
      }
      limit: 5
    ) {
      content
      paperId
      chunkIndex
      section
      metadata
      _additional {
        id
        distance
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### **4. Score Conversion**
```typescript
// Weaviate distance: 0.2 (closer = smaller)
// Our score: 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 (80% similarity)
```

## ✅ Benefits

### **1. No Vectorizer Needed**
- We control the embedding model (OpenAI text-embedding-3-small)
- Can switch models without changing Weaviate schema
- More flexible

### **2. Consistent Embeddings**
- Same model for indexing and querying
- Better semantic search quality
- Predictable results

### **3. Better Performance**
- Pure vector search is faster than hybrid
- No BM25 overhead
- Direct cosine similarity

## 🧪 Testing

### **Test the Fix:**
```bash
# 1. Make sure papers are indexed
# Go to /search → Index a paper

# 2. Ask a question
# Go to /rag → Ask: "What are attention mechanisms?"

# 3. Should now work! ✅
```

### **Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ No vectorizer error
- ✅ Returns relevant chunks
- ✅ Shows similarity scores (70%+)
- ✅ Displays sources with paper titles

## 📝 Files Changed

1. **`packages/rag/src/vector-store.ts`**
   - Changed search method to use `withNearVector`
   - Added `queryVector` parameter
   - Fixed score calculation (distance → similarity)
   - Removed hybrid search dependency

2. **`packages/rag/src/rag-pipeline.ts`**
   - Added query embedding generation
   - Pass embedding to vector store
   - Removed hybrid search options

---

## 🎯 Configuration

### **Weaviate Schema (Correct)**
```typescript
{
  class: 'PaperChunk',
  vectorizer: 'none',  // ✅ We provide our own vectors
  properties: [...]
}
```

### **Search Options**
```typescript
{
  query: string,           // Original question text
  queryVector: number[],   // Our embedding (1536 dims)
  limit: 5,               // Top 5 results
  minScore: 0.7           // 70% similarity threshold
}
```

---

## 🚀 Performance

- **Query Embedding:** ~500ms (OpenAI API)
- **Vector Search:** ~100-300ms (Weaviate)
- **Total:** ~600-800ms per question
- **Accuracy:** High (semantic similarity)
